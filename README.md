Skillence: E-Learning Mobile App (UI/UX Case Study)


🌟 Project Overview:


Skillence is a comprehensive UI/UX case study for a mobile-first e-learning platform. The project focuses on designing an intuitive, engaging, and feature-rich user experience for individuals looking to upskill in high-demand technical and creative domains.

Design Tool: Figma

Project Goal: To design a complete user journey from onboarding to course completion, emphasizing seamless navigation, gamification, and personalized learning.

Target Audience: Students and working professionals seeking to advance their careers through online courses (e.g., Data Science, UI/UX, Full Stack).

💡 Design Methodology & Process:


This project utilized a user-centered design (UCD) approach, focusing on key flows and interface patterns common in successful mobile applications.

1. User Flows & Wireframing
Mapped critical user journeys to ensure logical and efficient interaction:

Onboarding & Personalization: Capturing user interests and setting daily goals.

Secure Access: Designing clear and standard authentication and password recovery flows.

Learning Journey: Seamless navigation from course discovery to lesson consumption and assessment.

2. Visual Design & Style Guide
Aesthetic: Employed a vibrant, modern, and engaging visual style (predominantly pink/magenta) to appeal to a student audience.

Components: Designed reusable UI components for buttons, input fields, navigation tabs, and content cards, promoting design consistency across all screens.

✨ Key Design Deliverables:


The design covers the following major functional areas, demonstrating mastery of various mobile design patterns:

A. Onboarding & Authentication Flow
Entry Point Design: Splash screen and value proposition screen (page 1.jpg, page 2.png).

Credential Screens: Clear and accessible designs for Sign Up and Sign In including options for Social Login (page 8.png, page 3.png).

Security Design: Detailed four-step process for Password Reset (Forgot Password > OTP Entry > New Password Creation) (page 4.png, page 5.png, page 6.png).

B. Personalized Learning Experience
Interest Selection: Screen designed for users to quickly select relevant career interests (e.g., Python, Data Scientist, UI/UX) to personalize content (page 10.png).

Profile Design: A clean layout for viewing and setting user parameters like Beginner Level, Learning Goals, and language preferences (page 21.png).

Discovery & Home Screen: Designed for content prioritization, featuring Interested Courses, Explore Categories, and a prominent search bar (page 11.png).

C. Course Consumption & Completion Flow
Course Details Screen: Design of the course landing page, including video thumbnail, Playlist tab, and lesson checklist with completion indicators (page 12.jpg, page 13.png).

Progress Tracking: Visualized course progress in the Learning tab using clear percentage indicators and progress bars (page 19.png).

Saved Courses: Layout for managing and viewing enrolled courses with rating stars (page 18.png).

D. Assessment & Gamification Module
Quiz Interface: Clean, focused design for the Quizzing Engine with radio buttons for choice selection, minimizing distractions (page 14.png).

Results & Feedback: Design for the post-quiz summary, clearly showing Score, Correct/Wrong answers, and options for Certificate and Review Answer (page 15.png).

Social & Engagement: Designed a clear Leaderboard interface to foster competition and motivation based on points and ranking (page 17.png).

Success Screen: Design for the official Certificate of Course Completion screen (page 16.png).
